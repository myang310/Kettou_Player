## Randomized Media Player for Kettou's Cards

For those of you who recently bought the card game, Kettou, you'll notice that
there aren't any online tools to play the different media files provided by
Table Forged randomly and on command. Therefore, you would likely need a third
person on standby reading out a random card every round. Instead, why not have
a program automate that and have it call out a random card every round with the
press of a button? I have quickly written up a simple program runnable on the
terminal. All the necessary files to compile and run the program are included
in this repo. Simply compile and run the program per the commands below:

##### Compiling:
```bash
javac -cp ":./JLayer1.0.1/jl1.0.1.jar" Kettou.java
```

##### Running;
```bash
java -cp ":./JLayer1.0.1/jl1.0.1.jar" Kettou
```
